# Multi-Modal Data Curation from PDFs

## Overview
This is Part 2 of the tutorial that provides best practices for data curation in Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT).
The dataset used in this tutorial is small, making it ideal for developing and validating data curation pipelines on either a local machine or a computing cluster. The playbook employs specialized tools and techniques for high-quality text curation and refinement.

## Hardware Requirements
This playbook is compatible with both CPUs and GPUs.
While most steps can run on a CPU, the semantic and fuzzy deduplication modules require a GPU.
If GPUs are available, the PII redaction and exact deduplication processes will be accelerated.

## Walkthrough
The datasets used in this tutorial are located in the `NeMo-Curator/tutorials/multimodal_dapt_curation/ingest/sources/separated_extracted_data/data_type_map.json` file.

The tutorial follows these steps:
1. Install requirements and import libraries
2. Convert extracted data: Transform data from `nv-ingest` into Dask DataFrames and convert them to `DocumentDataset`.
3. Examine file types and sizes (optional)
4. Run the data curation pipeline with NeMo Curator:
   - Identify and separate file types
   - Perform document-level exact deduplication
   - Apply heuristic-based quality filtering (e.g., number of lines, word count, top N-grams)
   - Fix Unicode errors using `ftfy`
   - Redact PII
   - Execute GPU-accelerated fuzzy and semantic deduplication
5. Convert images extracted from nv-ingest into webdataset format
6. Apply semantic deduplication to get rid of duplicate images extracted
7. Save the filtered and curated data

## Interpreting the outputs
The tutorial provides detailed logging of the dataset curation process:
- It begins by printing the original dataset lengths for text extracted from different modalities, such as tables and charts.
- It then displays the progressive reductions in dataset size as various filters are applied:
   - Fuzzy deduplication
   - Semantic deduplication
   - Additional filtering mechanisms
- During the PII redaction step, the number of names and email addresses redacted from the dataset is also reported.
Once the tutorial completes, the final curated outputs are saved in the `curated/` directory. The results are organized by modality, such as `text/` or `tables_charts/`, for easy access and inspection.

## Usage
After installing the NeMo Curator package, install the required dependencies and run the pipeline using the following command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
python main.py --protocol "tcp" --rmm-pool-size "1GB" --device "gpu"
```
